## Description

Implement NextAuth.js v5 with credentials provider, create login page, add auth middleware for protected routes.

- **Parallel**: Can work alongside Task 001

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] NextAuth.js v5 configured with credentials provider
- [ ] Login page created (/login route)
- [ ] Auth middleware protecting /dashboard routes
- [ ] Session management working
- [ ] Logout functionality implemented

- Credentials provider for email/password authentication
- Middleware to protect routes under `/dashboard/*`
- Store session in JWT for serverless compatibility
- Follow NextAuth.js best practices for Next.js 15
