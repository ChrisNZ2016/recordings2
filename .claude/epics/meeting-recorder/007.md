# Task 007: Transcript Detail View

## Description

Build meeting detail page/modal to display full transcript with metadata, timestamps, and readable formatting.

## Size

M (16-24 hours)

## Dependencies

- **Task 006**: Meeting Dashboard UI (needs dashboard UI to navigate from)

## Conflicts

None

## Parallel Execution

No - depends on dashboard UI being complete

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Meeting detail route/modal created
- [ ] Full transcript displayed with formatting
- [ ] Meeting metadata panel (title, date, duration, platform)
- [ ] Timestamp navigation implemented
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Back to list navigation
- [ ] Loading states

## Technical Details

### Route Structure
- Create `/app/meetings/[id]/page.tsx` for detail view
- Or implement as modal overlay on dashboard

### Components to Build
- `MeetingDetail` - Main container component
- `TranscriptViewer` - Formatted transcript display
- `MetadataPanel` - Meeting information sidebar
- `TimestampNav` - Jump to specific times in transcript

### Data Fetching
- Server component fetch from Neon database via Drizzle ORM
- Query meeting by ID from `meetings` table
- Include transcript segments with timestamps
- Handle not found state

### UI/UX Requirements
- **Metadata Panel**: Display meeting title, date/time, duration, platform, participants
- **Transcript**: Readable formatting with speaker labels if available
- **Timestamps**: Clickable timestamps to jump to specific points
- **Navigation**: Clear back button to dashboard
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly layout with collapsible sidebar
- **Loading**: Skeleton states while fetching data

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS 4 for consistent design
- Match dashboard theme
- Typography optimized for long-form reading
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Route loads correctly with valid meeting ID
- [ ] 404 handling for invalid IDs
- [ ] Transcript renders with proper formatting
- [ ] Metadata displays all required fields
- [ ] Timestamp navigation works
- [ ] Back navigation returns to dashboard
- [ ] Responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Loading states appear appropriately
- [ ] Works with long transcripts (scroll performance)

## Notes

- Consider virtualization for very long transcripts
- May need to parse transcript format from recall.ai
- Timestamp format should match transcript structure
- Accessibility: proper heading structure, keyboard navigation
